# Getting Started

[This page](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) will help you install and build your first React Native app.

CLI commands:

* npm start
  Runs your app in development mode with an interactive prompt. To run it without a prompt, use the --no-interactive flag.

* npm test
  Runs the jest test runner on your tests.

* npm run ios
  Like npm start, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

* npm run android
  Like npm start, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools (see React Native docs for detailed setup).

* npm run eject
  This will start the process of "ejecting" from Create React Native App's build scripts. You'll be asked a couple of questions about how you'd like to build your project.
  Warning: Running eject is a permanent action. Please use a version control system, such as git, so you can revert back if necessary. An ejected app will require you to have an Xcode and/or Android Studio environment set up.
